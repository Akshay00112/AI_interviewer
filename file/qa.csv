How is the loss function used in supervised learning?,"In machine learning , supervised learning ( SL ) is a paradigm where a model is trained using input objects (e.g. a vector of predictor variables) and desired output values (also known as a supervisory signal ), which are often human-made labels. The training process builds a function that maps new data to expected output values. [ 1 ] An optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to accurately determine output values for unseen instances. This requires the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a reasonable way (see inductive bias ). This statistical quality of an algorithm is measured via a generalization error .

To solve a given problem of supervised learning, the following steps must be performed:

A wide range of supervised learning algorithms are available, each with its strengths and weaknesses. There is no single learning algorithm that works best on all supervised learning problems (see the No free lunch theorem ).

There are four major issues to consider in supervised learning:

A first issue is the tradeoff between bias and variance . [ 2 ] Imagine that we have available several different, but equally good, training data sets. A learning algorithm is biased for a particular input x {\displaystyle x} if, when trained on each of these data sets, it is systematically incorrect when predicting the correct output for x {\displaystyle x} . A learning algorithm has high variance for a particular input x {\displaystyle x} if it predicts different output values when trained on different training sets. The prediction error of a learned classifier is related to the sum of the bias and the variance of the learning algorithm. [ 3 ] Generally, there is a tradeoff between bias and variance. A learning algorithm with low bias must be ""flexible"" so that it can fit the data well. But if the learning algorithm is too flexible, it will fit each training data set differently, and hence have high variance. A key aspect of many supervised learning methods is that they are able to adjust this tradeoff between bias and variance (either automatically or by providing a bias/variance parameter that the user can adjust).

The second issue is of the amount of training data available relative to the complexity of the ""true"" function (classifier or regression function). If the true function is simple, then an ""inflexible"" learning algorithm with high bias and low variance will be able to learn it from a small amount of data. But if the true function is highly complex (e.g., because it involves complex interactions among many different input features and behaves differently in different parts of the input space), then the function will only be able to learn with a large amount of training data paired with a ""flexible"" learning algorithm with low bias and high variance.

A third issue is the dimensionality of the input space. If the input feature vectors have large dimensions, learning the function can be difficult even if the true function only depends on a small number of those features. This is because the many ""extra"" dimensions can confuse the learning algorithm and cause it to have high variance. Hence, input data of large dimensions typically requires tuning the classifier to have low variance and high bias. In practice, if the engineer can manually remove irrelevant features from the input data, it will likely improve the accuracy of the learned function. In addition, there are many algorithms for feature selection that seek to identify the relevant features and discard the irrelevant ones. This is an instance of the more general strategy of dimensionality reduction , which seeks to map the input data into a lower-dimensional space prior to running the supervised learning algorithm.

A fourth issue is the degree of noise in the desired output values (the supervisory target variables ). If the desired output values are often incorrect (because of human error or sensor errors), then the learning algorithm should not attempt to find a function that exactly matches the training examples. Attempting to fit the data too carefully leads to overfitting . You can overfit even when there are no measurement errors (stochastic noise) if the function you are trying to learn is too complex for your learning model. In such a situation, the part of the target function that cannot be modeled ""corrupts"" your training data - this phenomenon has been called deterministic noise . When either type of noise is present, it is better to go with a higher bias, lower variance estimator.

In practice, there are several approaches to alleviate noise in the output values such as early stopping to prevent overfitting as well as detecting and removing the noisy training examples prior to training the supervised learning algorithm. There are several algorithms that identify noisy training examples and removing the suspected noisy training examples prior to training has decreased generalization error with statistical significance . [ 4 ] [ 5 ]

Other factors to consider when choosing and applying a learning algorithm include the following:

When considering a new application, the engineer can compare multiple learning algorithms and experimentally determine which one works best on the problem at hand (see cross-validation ). Tuning the performance of a learning algorithm can be very time-consuming. Given fixed resources, it is often better to spend more time collecting additional training data and more informative features than it is to spend extra time tuning the learning algorithms.

The most widely used learning algorithms are:

Given a set of N {\displaystyle N} training examples of the form { ( x 1 , y 1 ) , . . . , ( x N , y N ) } {\displaystyle \{(x_{1},y_{1}),...,(x_{N},\;y_{N})\}} such that x i {\displaystyle x_{i}} is the feature vector of the i {\displaystyle i} -th example and y i {\displaystyle y_{i}} is its label (i.e., class), a learning algorithm seeks a function g : X → Y {\displaystyle g:X\to Y} , where X {\displaystyle X} is the input space and Y {\displaystyle Y} is the output space. The function g {\displaystyle g} is an element of some space of possible functions G {\displaystyle G} , usually called the hypothesis space . It is sometimes convenient to represent g {\displaystyle g} using a scoring function f : X × Y → R {\displaystyle f:X\times Y\to \mathbb {R} } such that g {\displaystyle g} is defined as returning the y {\displaystyle y} value that gives the highest score: g ( x ) = arg ⁡ max y f ( x , y ) {\displaystyle g(x)={\underset {y}{\arg \max }}\;f(x,y)} . Let F {\displaystyle F} denote the space of scoring functions.

Although G {\displaystyle G} and F {\displaystyle F} can be any space of functions, many learning algorithms are probabilistic models where g {\displaystyle g} takes the form of a conditional probability model g ( x ) = arg ⁡ max y P ( y | x ) {\displaystyle g(x)={\underset {y}{\arg \max }}\;P(y|x)} , or f {\displaystyle f} takes the form of a joint probability model f ( x , y ) = P ( x , y ) {\displaystyle f(x,y)=P(x,y)} . For example, naive Bayes and linear discriminant analysis are joint probability models, whereas logistic regression is a conditional probability model.

There are two basic approaches to choosing f {\displaystyle f} or g {\displaystyle g} : empirical risk minimization and structural risk minimization . [ 6 ] Empirical risk minimization seeks the function that best fits the training data. Structural risk minimization includes a penalty function that controls the bias/variance tradeoff.

In both cases, it is assumed that the training set consists of a sample of independent and identically distributed pairs , ( x i , y i ) {\displaystyle (x_{i},\;y_{i})} . In order to measure how well a function fits the training data, a loss function L : Y × Y → R ≥ 0 {\displaystyle L:Y\times Y\to \mathbb {R} ^{\geq 0}} is defined. For training example ( x i , y i ) {\displaystyle (x_{i},\;y_{i})} , the loss of predicting the value y ^ {\displaystyle {\hat {y}}} is L ( y i , y ^ ) {\displaystyle L(y_{i},{\hat {y}})} .

The risk R ( g ) {\displaystyle R(g)} of function g {\displaystyle g} is defined as the expected loss of g {\displaystyle g} . This can be estimated from the training data as"

Supervised Models Supervised learning is the study of algorithms that use labeled data in which each data instance has a known category or value to which it belongs. This results in the model to discover the relationship between the input features and the target outcome. 1.1 Classification The classifier algorithms are designed to indicate whether a new data point belongs to one or another among several predefined classes. Imagine when you are organising emails into spam or inbox, categorising images as cat or dog, or predicting whether a loan applicant is a credible borrower. In the classification models, there is a learning process by the use of labeled examples from each category. In this process, they discover the correlations and relations within the data that help to distinguish class one from the other classes.
